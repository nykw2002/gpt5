2 Executive Summary and New Recommendations
v
A review of Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray (FFNS) was carried out including the 12 points
i
required by EU GMP/WHO. The following trends were identified:
t
Mould on HEPA Filters c
DE 201389239 in this review was a repeat of DE 201246642 documented in the previous review.
The CAPA identified following investigaetion into DE 201246642, had not yet been implemented at
the time DE 201389239 was raised; actions have now been completed; refer to section 5.5 for
further details. f
f
Slurry Addition
Major deviation DEV-007640 wEas assessed as a repeat of DEV-006557. Actions identified from
investigation into DEV-006557 were in progress at the time DEV-007640 occurred.
Method Statements
Major DE 201413889 was assessed as a repeat deviation of Major DE 201409895 (raised against
a different product). The CAPA identified from the investigation into DE 201409895 was in
progress at the time DE 201413889 occurred.
Incorrect Temperature Documented
DE 201415317 was assessed as a repeat of DE 201139462 (documented in a previous review).
In process control, analytical and stability data continue to support existing specifications and life
to expiry.
A review of the cumulative impact of change, deviations and data analysis indicates the process
remains validated and in a state of control.
FFNS is also manufactured at GSK Aranda and the PPR from the site was reviewed (refer to
VQD-Q&AU-054618). No observations or recommendations were identified.

Data sourced from: VQD-REC-110715- 6.0 Date data was sourced: 18 June 2024
All CQA Ppk data are greater than or equal to 0.95 and therefore indicate acceptable process capability.
A review of the PPA breakage and risk log showed no new risks over the review period. Droplet Size Distribution (DSD) continues to be
monitored as a low risk but the current Ppk values of 1.57, 2.01 and 1.97 for the D10Âµm, D50Âµm, D90Âµm respectively demonstrates the
critical quality attributes remain under good control. These attributes will continue to be monitored as part of the PPA process but no further
action is required at this time.
The Product Control Strategy (PCS) CPV Data Trending Plan (VQD-RPT-084756) and Technical Risk Assessment (reference VQD-RPT-
088318) were reviewed and deemed appropriate; no further action is required. The alert limits for each test were reviewed and are deemed
appropriate.
No skip lot testing is performed for the Analytical Laboratory tests.

5.3 Critical Process Parameters, Yield and In-Process Controls Data
Critical Process Parameters and In-process controls for this product are trended as defined in Data Trending Plan VQD-RPT-084756.
Critical Process Parameters and In-process controls must be within a defined range of values. Any issues found are reported through
the deviation system.
There were two in-process control deviations recorded for this review period.
Split ring appearance
e
DEV-006099 (Major) - Spilt ring appearance check failure:
During manufacture of batch EB6A, a number of bottles were found to have mvisaligned split ring and collars resulting in <5 complete join
welds. Fault was attributed to a failing cylinder on Track 5 within the Sortimat; the lift cylinder was replaced.
i
Work order 103870092 not populated correctly resulting in poor understanding of what components have been changed, additionally, the
t
routine maintenance type (P4) 400121581 is not sufficient to ensure the related work orders are resolved to a satisfactory level as to not
c
impact quality. CAPA completed: Update maintenance routine 40021581 from P4 to a P1.
Part batch rejection was completed (documented in Table 5e.1-1).
f
Seal height check
f
DEV-007532 (Major) - Seal height check out of limits on CP12 filling line:
E
Seal height check reading of 5.25mm, outside of the acceptable limits of 4.8 - 5.2mm. The most likely attributable root cause is a
documentation error in which the operator wrote the incorrect value for the seal height. It was evident within the human reliability
assessment and would account for all bracketing readings being within limit without engineering intervention. However, as this was just
the most likely attributable root cause, and there is no way to verify the data point to be a documentation error, all boxes from the end of
batch to the last satisfactory seal height check performed, were rejected.
CAPA CPA-066907 ongoing: Batch Document Set (BDS) update to ensure limits visible on all pages seal height check performed.
Part batch rejection was completed on batch H38M (documented in Table 5.1-1).
Output Yields/Process Losses for manufactured and filled product must be within a defined range of values. Any issues found for yield or
process losses are reported through the deviation system.
There were no yield/process loss deviations recorded in this review period.
There is no underlying trend and no further action is required. The process remains under control.

One investigation was raised when FF content was marginally outside the atypicality limit. The results fitted with the data trend at time
but were sufficient to be fractionally outside of tight atypicality limits. The FF content over the review period remains a highly capable
process against the specification with a Ppk of 2.87.
Two investigations were raised when DSD D50 mean was marginally outside the atypicality limit. The results fitted with the data trend at
time but were sufficient to be fractionally outside of tight atypicality limits. The DSD D50 content over the review period remains a highly
capable process against the specification with a Ppk of 2.01.
Based on the cause category, no trends were identified.

There has been no step change in the Device Investigation Reports (DIR) which have been performed with respect to FFNS over this
review period. Also, none of these investigations required escalation to the LI process and were all satisfactory upon meeting the
additional requirements of the DIR process.

Repeat Deviations

Method Statements c
Major DE 201413889 was assessed as a repeat deviation of Major DE 201409895 (raised against a different product). The CAPA
e
identified from the investigation into DE 201409895 was in progress at the time DE 201413889 occurred:
f
DE 201409895 - Problem: Controlled Print of methfod statement printed but not used and cannot be located. Draft copy also present in
area and used in error. Cause: The recent roleE changes of both the Operations Manager and the First Line Leader (FLL) leading to
assumptions being made and poor communication. Increase in atypical activity in the area meant usual processes were not followed.
CAPA CA 201418616 completed:
- Deliver Stop for Quality slides which will contain coaching material on control of GMP documentation within the area.
DE 201413889 - Problem: Method statements physically destroyed. Cause: Clarity of instruction delivered by FLL and misinterpretation
of the instruction by the Mover in addition to multiple method statements in use in area at once.
CAPA CA 201425539 completed:
- Update the Method Statement tracker with improved visibility and control of all method statements within the department and their
status.
With reference to Table 5.5-2 - Minor deviations, DE 201424600 investigated a method statement which was out of date; this was
assessed as not a repeat:
DE 201424600 - Method Statement - VQD-OPS-100235 - MS- LIQUIDS -To control the replacement of inlet air filters in the inhalations
isolator between APIs, used beyond its expiry date of 15 Oct 2023.
Root cause has been identified as a possible knowledge gap of the production personnel in the method statement process.

No further CAPA required. CAPAs already in progress (CA 201418616 and 201425539 referenced above).
Mould on HEPA Filters
Major DE 201389239 was classified as a repeat of Major DE 201246642 (recorded in the previous review). These were raised for mould
found on HEPA filters. The CAPA from the first DE was ongoing when the second DE occurred, the interim controls from DE 201389239
have been improved to make them more robust.
Interim controls introduced under DE 201246642 were implemented to prevent a repeat event of mould occurring on the HVAC. This
e
included the introduction of pre-emptive checks through a P1 (Quality Critical) work order maintenance plan (MP 40059572 Inspect AHU
HEPA Filters. The refined interim control is a shift in focus to detection of convditions and allowing proactive change out of HEPA filters
before Mould has time to grow where adverse conditions have been observed, through increased monitoring of temperature / humidity
i
and AHU increased moisture levels). The interim control improvements under DE 201389239 included an increase on the work order
t
frequency, addition of instructions for actioning alarms and escalation communication requirements should any adverse conditions be
c
observed. In addition, the risk presented by the current HVAC systems was added to the Site Risk Register, risk number RE-008618.
e
The implementation plan and upgrade of HVACs will bfe progressed under project 7470GB-IM-23069 and MC 000201423919.

E
Slurry Addition
Major deviation DEV-007640 was assessed as a repeat of DEV-006557. Actions identified from investigation into DEV-006557 were in
progress at the time DEV-007640 occurred:
DEV-006557 and DEV-007640
Problem statement: The operators charged slurried API that had exceeded its wait time into the bulk suspension because the BDS did
not have any controls to prevent the addition of the BDS prior to completing the activity.
Root Cause: There is a bold statement at the top of the BDS on page 20, but no calculation or statement to confirm that a 1hr period has
not lapsed.
CAPA CPA-059740 ongoing : BDS needs to be updated to provide a requirement to calculate the time the slurried API must be charged
into the suspension to ensure 1hour hasn't been exceeded. The step needs to act as a prompt prior to charging in the material to
prevent the addition going forward.
Incorrect Temperature Documented
DE 201415317 was assessed as a repeat of DE 201139462 (documented in the 2022 FFNS PPR; refer to VQD-Q&AU-029690 -
Barnard Castle PPR 2022 Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray and FFNS Placebo).

201139462 - Problem: Temperature of WFI not recorded on step A9 of the manufacture process.
Cause: Lack of clarity in the Batch Document Set (BDS). CAPA CA 201149488 was completed to update the BDS:
201415317 - Problem: Second operator did not identify the incorrect temperature when carrying out the verification of the task.
Cause: No distinction between who is/is not acting as the verifier in some instances.
CAPA CA 201427512 completed: Update to VQD-SOP-025150 - Procedure for the use of the WFI Water Systems in Liquid Inhalations.
With reference to Table 5.5-1, Deviation DEV-006667 was raised to investigate the incorrect WFI temperature during Disodium Edetate
e
(EDTA) addition process. This was assessed as not a repeat.
CAPA CPA-061759 was identified from the investigation and is in progress: v
Incorrect WFI temp selected in Inhalations Manufacture - The displayed selection process screens will be changed to divide up the 4
i
options â 1 will be for VRS only and the other 3 for FFNS. The 3 different selections for FFNS will also each have their own display
t
screens, and will follow in sequential order, thus making it simpler for the operator to select the correct temperature, at the correct stage
c
of the process.

There were twelve deviations classified as minor related to product manufactured during the review period. There was also one linked

Major DEV-006494 and Minor DEV-008493 had the same defect location (Manufacturing), defect type (Cleaning - Cleaning Failure) and
cause type (Method); these were assessed as not repeats:
DEV-006494 - BKC pipework cleaning failure.
Problem: Residue observed on cleaning dedicated BKC addition pipework following heightened inspection using a torch.
Root Cause: Whilst cleaning the BKC additions pipe it is possible that foam residues formed over time and remained undetected; following
the introduction of an optimised method of inspection, there was an increased level of detection.
CAPA CPA-059744 ongoing: Order new BKC addition pipework.
e
DEV-008493 - Discolouration observed on swabs for residual Fluticasone Furoate from FFNS Tank 4.
Electropolishing is generally considered as the most efficient way of generatving a stainless steel (SS) surface finish with a uniform and
effective corrosion resistance surface (or passive layer). However, multiple derouging processes such as chemical cleans and
i
electropolishing can increase risk of rouging on vessels. Rouging is an inherent mechanism that occurs on SS surfaces.
t
The swabbing medium used is 70:30 Methanol:Water and the purpose of the swabbing exercise is for product residue identification.
c
Alcohol has the ability to lift Class I migratory rouge from the surface of the SS which may be contained in the microstructure of the metal.
No CAPA. e
f
Minor DE 201371206 and Minor DE 201424476 hafd the same defect location (Manufacturing), defect type (Foundations, Personnel and

DE 201421333
Problem: Rouge was observed in manufacturing vessels during additional inspections related to product related residues. The rouge in
vessels was detected following off-site contractor activity which followed a non-optimal process for stainless steel polishing and
passivation.
Cause: The cause of the rouging was that vessels were subjected to a non-optimal mechanical polishing and chemical treatment
process which left metallic residues embedded in the polished surfaces which were incompletely passivated when the vessels were
exposed to the CIP/SIP process. The vessels were accepted back into use without a full consideration of PCCE and cleaning risks. The
root cause of both the non-optimal process and the lack of cleaning and PCCE asseessment was a lack of written guidance relating to the
selection of appropriate polishing and chemical treatment processes in conjunction with the use of the existing Engineering Change
v
Control Process.
CAPA CA 201433102 ongoing: i
- Perform electropolishing of all VRS vessels to optimise the surfacet finish and definitively passivate the product contact surfaces
- Create a site-wide SOP to formalise the control of stainless steecl manufacturing equipment subjected to maintenance activity which has
the potential to impact surface finish and corrosion resistance. In particular, the SOP will highlight the need to select the most
e
appropriate engineering techniques to repair, maintain and modify this type of equipment. Additionally, the SOP will highlight the need to
f
use the Engineering Change Control process and consider the impact of polishing and passivation in the PCCE and cleaning
assessments. f
The completion of ongoing CAPA will be documEented in the next review (in Table 5.5-3).

The review above concludes that supplier performance is satisfactory, and no action is required.
The executive summary of the PPR associated with the API, which is supplied via GSK Jurong, has been reviewed and there were no
recommendations applicable to the supply of the material to Barnard Castle. Refer to VQD-Q&AU-042805 - Jurong PPR 2023
Fluticasone Furoate (PB3).
In the previous API PPR review (VQD-Q&AU-030572 - Jurong PPR 2022 Fluticasone Furoate [PB3]) there were recommendations to
perform close monitoring of assay content and specific rotation for subsequent campaigns following atypical (low) results. This has been
completed. All batches reviewed to be within the established typical limits. The process remained in control and the limits deemed to be
appropriate for the next review.
The executive summary of the PPR associated with the micronised API, which is supplied via GSK Ware, has been reviewed and there
were no recommendations applicable to the supply of the material to Barnard Castle. Refer to VQD-Q&AU-079320 - Ware PPR 2024
Fluticasone Furoate Micronised API.
The information within the API VQD-OPS-009202 and product supply chain map VQD-OPS-026903 was reviewed. API and product
supply chain maps contain the correct information and are appropriate.
