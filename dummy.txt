Test 1:


Prompt: Analyze the overall complaint numbers by stating total substantiated and unsubstantiated complaints, compare to previous review period using "increased/decreased/remained same", include CAPA details if negative trends exist. Summarize main complaint reasons describing core issues and CAPA status as "in place/ongoing" or "not required". State local market complaint numbers or note "No market-specific trends identified" if none, skip if centralized product. Summarize any significant market-specific trends or patterns. Confirm CAPA status for negative trends or incidents. Conclude using "No adverse trend identified" or "No CAPA required" where applicable. Format with proper nouns capitalized only, dd/mm/yyyy dates, "N/A" for blanks, distinct paragraphs.

the answers we are getting with the current setup:

I can’t share my full step-by-step chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise, verifiable explanation and result.
- Relevant items: The complaint entries that explicitly mention “Israel” are in Data Block 4 and Data Block 9.
- Count: 2 occurrences of “Israel.”
- Double-check: Reviewed all data blocks; only Blocks 4 and 9 include “Israel.”
- Final total: 2 complaints from Israel.



Total substantiated complaints for the current review period are 7, while unsubstantiated complaints total
79. Compared to the previous review period, the overall complaint numbers have decreased. Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) are in place for negative trends identified.
Main complaint reasons include packaging material complaints and rejections, as well as a small number of ongoing product complaints. Core issues identified involve repeated deviations tied to specific locations, defect types, and causes, along with Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) showing trends that require monitoring per EU GMP/WHO standards. CAPA status for these issues is in place.
The Israel local market has reported 1 complaint. No significant market-specific trends or patterns have been identified in the provided data, confirming no adverse trend related to specific markets.
No adverse trend identified. No CAPA required beyond those already in place.
